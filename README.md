# Python-Tkinter-Code-Generator
This repository contains a Python script that generates a code based on cost input using tkinter GUI. It maps digits to letters in a predefined word and displays the resulting code dynamically.
## How it Works

- The script takes input in the form of cost.
- Each digit in the cost is mapped to a corresponding letter from a predefined word.
- The generated code is displayed on the screen.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the cost in the provided input field.
3. The code will be generated and displayed instantly.
4. You can also see the generated code by typing the cost.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library

## Running the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install tkinter library if not available.
3. Run the script using Python interpreter.

## Example

If you enter the cost as "12345", the generated code will be "ONTHRM".

Feel free to modify and integrate this script into your projects as needed.
